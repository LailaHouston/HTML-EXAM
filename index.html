    <h2>The Start of IOS: iOS 1-3 </h2>
<h3><i>iOS 1</i> was announced on January 9, 2007 by Apple. Six months later, it was officially released to the public on June 29. It was Apple’s first operating system that was for a touch-centric device. Steve Jobs, Apple’s late and former CEO, called it a software that would run as a mobile version of OS X. <i>iOS 1</i> included Core iOS UI, multitouch gestures, mobile Safari, IPod, visual voicemail, maps, and iTunes Sync. It was compatible with iPhone 1st generation. After a year, on July 11, 2008, Apple released iOS 2 after announcing it a few months before in March 2008. This time, iOS was compatible with iPhone 1st Generation, iPhone 3G, and iPod touch 1st Generation. iOS 2 included added language support, extra languages for keyboards, mail, contacts, calendars, the ability to move and delete multiple emails, enterprise enhancements, bug fixes, and more. It was free to people with iPhone 1st generation but if you had a iPod touch, you had to pay $9.95 for the upgrade. In iOS 2.2, which is just a better improvement of iOS 2, apple added a remote button for Nike + iPod. It would allow people to control their devices that are supported with apple. In March 17, 2009, it was announced that iOS 3 was in the making, and after two months on June 17, 2009, iOS 13 and iPhone 3GS was released. iOS was compatible with all devices for apple but on the first iPhone, some features were left off. Cut, copy, paste, stocks, YouTube, Bluetooth, and more were added to iOS 3. </h3>
