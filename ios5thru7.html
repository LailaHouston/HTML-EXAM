<h3 class="paragraph3">On June 6, 2011, Apple had announced their new iOS version, <I>iOS 5</i>, during a worldwide event. <I>IOS 5</i> was released on October 12 of 2011. During that same time, the iPhone 4s was also released. Because Apple released support of iOS 4.3 for the 2nd generation of the iPod Touch and for the iPhone 3G months ago, they did not let any of the devices get any new support.  Because of this, Apple allowed <I>iOS 5</i> support the 1st generation of the iPad, iPad 2, 3rd generation for the iPod Touch and newer iPod devices, and the iPhone 3GS and newer. Things like Reminders, Twitter integration, Game Center, the ability to no longer need to use iTunes USB to connect a new device to a computer, Siri voice control, and more were added to the software. After a year, on June 11, 2012, Apple told the world that it would be releasing another version of iOS, <I>iOS 6</i>. Apple released the new version on September 19, 2012. They also released iPhone 5 that same year. <I>IOS 6</i> supported iPad 2, iPad generations 3-4, iPad Mini, iPhone 3GS-5, and iPod touch 4th and 5th generation. Apple limited the support of the version for iPhone 3GS and the 4th generation of iPod Touch. One year later, Apple announced on June 10, 2013 and released <I>iOS 7</i> in September of 2013. Alongside <I>iOS 7</i>, they released iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. Apple later then dropped the iPhone 3GS and 4th generation of iPod Touch because they had their own limitations.</h3>
